<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Static Neutralizing Blower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The static neutralizing blower market can be divided into two primary types: active and passive systems. Active neutralizing blowers use ionization techniques to actively neutralize static charges on surfaces, providing more effective and immediate discharge of static electricity. In contrast, passive neutralizing blowers rely on airflow to disperse charged particles but do not actively generate ions. While active systems are typically used in high-risk static-sensitive environments, passive systems are suited for less critical applications where immediate charge neutralization is not as vital.</p></p>
