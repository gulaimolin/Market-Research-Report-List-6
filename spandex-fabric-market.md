<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spandex Fabric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Dry Spinning</li><li>Solution Wet Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spandex fabric market features two primary types of production methods: solution dry spinning and solution wet spinning. Solution dry spinning involves dissolving spandex in a solvent, then extruding it through a spinneret into heated air to evaporate the solvent, creating fibers. In contrast, solution wet spinning involves dissolving the spandex in a liquid solution, which is then extruded into a coagulating bath, forming fibers as the solvent is absorbed. Both methods significantly influence the texture, elasticity, and performance of spandex fabrics.</p></p>
