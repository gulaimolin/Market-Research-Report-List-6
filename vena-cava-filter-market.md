<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vena Cava Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inferior Vena Cava Filter</li><li>Superior Vena Cava Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vena Cava Filter market is categorized into two main types: Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filters and Superior Vena Cava (SVC) filters. IVC filters are primarily used to prevent pulmonary embolism by capturing blood clots from the lower body. They are inserted into the inferior vena cava, a large vein that carries blood from the lower regions of the body to the heart. Conversely, SVC filters address venous thromboembolism risks in patients with conditions affecting the upper body by filtering clots from the superior vena cava. Both types are crucial for managing venous thromboembolism.</p></p>
