<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Halogenated Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosphorous</li><li>Nitrogenous</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-halogenated flame retardants are classified into three main categories - phosphorous based, nitrogenous based, and other types. Phosphorous based flame retardants work by releasing phosphoric acid when exposed to high temperatures, forming a protective char layer on the material surface. Nitrogenous flame retardants release inert gases when heated, diluting the oxygen concentration and suppressing the combustion process. Other types include mineral-based and intumescent flame retardants, which work by swelling and forming insulating layers on the material surface to prevent the spread of flames.</p></p>
