<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer’s Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Donepezil</li><li>Memantine</li><li>Rivastigmine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's therapeutics market comprises several key medications, primarily Donepezil, Memantine, and Rivastigmine. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor that enhances cognitive function by increasing acetylcholine levels, while Rivastigmine operates similarly but is available in both oral and transdermal forms. Memantine, on the other hand, is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that helps regulate glutamate activity, offering neuroprotective benefits. Together, these medications address symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, focusing on improving memory and cognitive performance in patients.</p></p>
