<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifocal Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) market is divided into two main types: pre-loaded IOLs and non-pre-loaded IOLs. Pre-loaded IOLs come pre-packaged in a delivery device, allowing for quick and sterile insertion during cataract surgery, enhancing surgical efficiency. Non-pre-loaded IOLs, on the other hand, require surgeons to manually load the lens into the injector, potentially increasing operation time and complexity. Both types aim to provide improved vision at multiple distances, catering to diverse patient needs post-surgery.</p></p>
