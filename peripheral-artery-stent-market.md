<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Artery Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drug-eluting Stent</li><li>Bare Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral artery stents are medical devices used to open narrow or blocked blood vessels in the peripheral arteries. There are two main types of peripheral artery stents: drug-eluting stents and bare stents. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication that helps prevent the formation of scar tissue inside the artery, reducing the risk of re-narrowing. Bare stents, on the other hand, do not contain any medication and rely solely on the metal scaffold to keep the artery open. Both types of stents are commonly used in treating peripheral artery disease.</p></p>
