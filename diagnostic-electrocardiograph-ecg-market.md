<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diagnostic Electrocardiograph (ECG) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resting ECG</li><li>Stress ECG</li><li>Holter ECG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diagnostic electrocardiograph (ECG) market is categorized into three main types: Resting ECG, Stress ECG, and Holter ECG. Resting ECG records the heart's electrical activity while the patient is at rest, providing baseline information. Stress ECG monitors heart function during physical exertion, helping to assess the heart's response to stress. Holter ECG is a continuous monitoring system, typically worn for 24-48 hours, capturing daily heart activity to identify irregularities that may not appear during shorter tests.</p></p>
