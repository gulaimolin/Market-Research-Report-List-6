<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breathing Circuit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Semi-Open</li><li>Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Breathing circuit markets can be categorized into three types: open, semi-open, and closed circuits. </p><p>In an open circuit, gases are expelled into the atmosphere after use, requiring constant replenishment. Semi-open circuits recycle some gases while still allowing for exhalation into the environment, thus conserving resources. Closed circuits maintain a sealed system where exhaled gases are fully recaptured and reprocessed, maximizing efficiency and minimizing waste, often used in specific medical or diving applications for optimal gas management.</p></p>
