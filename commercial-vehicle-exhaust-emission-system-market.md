<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR system</li><li>EGR system</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Market primarily includes two types: SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) and EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) systems. SCR systems use a urea-based liquid to convert harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) into harmless nitrogen and water, significantly reducing emissions. In contrast, EGR systems recirculate a portion of exhaust gases back into the engine’s intake, lowering combustion temperatures and NOx formation. Both technologies are essential for meeting stringent environmental regulations in commercial vehicles, enhancing sustainability in the transportation sector.</p></p>
