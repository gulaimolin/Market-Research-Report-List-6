<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent borne</li><li>Waterborne</li><li>Powder-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Epoxy coatings are categorized into three main types: solvent-borne, waterborne, and powder-based. Solvent-borne epoxy coatings contain organic solvents, offering excellent adhesion and durability but emitting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Waterborne epoxy coatings use water as the primary solvent, resulting in lower VOC emissions, making them more environmentally friendly. Powder-based epoxy coatings are applied in a dry powder form and cured under heat, providing a durable finish without solvents, ideal for industrial applications. Each type serves distinct needs based on application and environmental considerations.</p></p>
