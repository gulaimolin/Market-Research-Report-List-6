<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Button Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The suture button market can be categorized into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable suture buttons are designed to degrade over time through natural biological processes, eliminating the need for a second surgical procedure for removal, making them ideal for temporary applications in soft tissue repairs. Conversely, non-absorbable suture buttons remain in the body indefinitely, providing long-term support for more complex procedures, such as bone fixation or ligament reconstruction, where durability and strength are essential.</p></p>
